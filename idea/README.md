My idea for the hackathon:

सहYOG(pronounced: Sehyog, meaning: someone or something that is of assistance). 

सहYOG leverages the power of co-savings and commitment to promote economic freedom within rural women by helping them form online Self Help Groups. We spread awareness and intelligently make SHGs online by connecting women across the country, where the gender ratio is neglected and female foeticides prevail, in order to help them save up an ample sum.

The entire country, specifically the rural areas faced huge losses during the pandemic. Lockdowns were implemented and there was a growing concern whether we would ever be able to meet out and get back to our everyday lives. Keeping this in mind, we at सहYOG help in forming online SHGs so that no direct physical contact or meetings are required. On our website any woman from the rural areas can generate a request to form a SHG and we will provide her with other members of similar interest or she can become a member of an existing SHG. We compare banks and their policies for creating savings account specifically for SHGs and deliver the best knowledge to our self made SHGs.

Basically we have 2 phases of implementation for our dual idea. For the first phase we will be implementing the creation of SHGs/joining an existing SHG. Our second phase is to compare various banks for their SHG programmes and list out the details for our customers to choose which fits best to them. We also provide our insight on the matter of which program seems most beneficial to the particular SHGs.

Coming to the technical part, we will be implementing the website using React.js, and for the backend we will be using Microsoft Azure Services, such as Node.js, etc. Azure SQL database would be used to store information. The code for this project was written on Visual Studio Code, which is a part of the Microsoft Azure Services as well.

Tech Stack: React.js, Microsoft Azure Service of Node.js, Azure SQL database, Bootstrap.
